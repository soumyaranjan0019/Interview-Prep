SQL Basics for Beginners: Must-Know Concepts

1. What is SQL?  
   SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to communicate with databases. It allows you to query, update, and manage relational databases by writing simple or complex queries.

2. SQL Syntax  
   SQL is written using statements, which consist of keywords like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc. to perform operations on the data.
   - SQL keywords are not case-sensitive, but it's common to write them in uppercase (e.g., SELECT, FROM).

3. SQL Data Types  
   Databases store data in different formats. The most common data types are:
   - INT (Integer): For whole numbers.
   - VARCHAR(n) or TEXT: For storing text data.
   - DATE: For dates.
   - DECIMAL: For precise decimal values, often used in financial calculations.

4. Basic SQL Queries  
   Here are some fundamental SQL operations:

   - SELECT Statement: Used to retrieve data from a database.
    
SQL

     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
     
   - WHERE Clause: Filters data based on conditions.
    
SQL

     SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
     
   - ORDER BY: Sorts data in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
    
SQL

     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC;
     
   - LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned.
    
SQL

     SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 5;
     
5. Filtering Data with WHERE Clause  
   The WHERE clause helps you filter data based on a condition:
  
SQL

   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
   
   You can use comparison operators like:
   - =: Equal to
   - >: Greater than
   - <: Less than
   - LIKE: For pattern matching

6. Aggregating Data  
   SQL provides functions to summarize or aggregate data:
   - COUNT(): Counts the number of rows.
    
SQL

     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
     
   - SUM(): Adds up values in a column.
    
SQL

     SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;
     
   - AVG(): Calculates the average value.
    
SQL

     SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
     
   - GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
    
SQL

     SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
     
7. Joins in SQL  
   Joins combine data from two or more tables:
   - INNER JOIN: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.
    
SQL

     SELECT employees.name, departments.department
     FROM employees
     INNER JOIN departments
     ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
     
   - LEFT JOIN: Retrieves all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
    
SQL

     SELECT employees.name, departments.department
     FROM employees
     LEFT JOIN departments
     ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
     
8. Inserting Data
   To add new data to a table, you use the INSERT INTO statement:
  
SQL

   INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Analyst', 60000);
   
9. Updating Data
   You can update existing data in a table using the UPDATE statement:
  
SQL

   UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE name = 'John Doe';
   
10. Deleting Data
    To remove data from a table, use the DELETE statement:
   
SQL

    DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';
